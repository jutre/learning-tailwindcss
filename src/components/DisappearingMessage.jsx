 * Component that intended to be used for animating some message gradual hiding after it has been displayed. Intended to be 
 * used to show message that some event has completed like data saved or deleted and after that hiding that message.
 * It is achieved by letting create css transitions when html element styling changes by adding addition html class to element.
 * Div containing message is rendered for first time with certain html classes and after speficified time elapses
 * re-rendered for second time with  additional class added. 
 * To work correctly this component must be added to comsuming component's render function produced jsx at moment 
 * when message must be displayed using 
 *  {condition && <DisappearingMessage/>} 
 * to achieve effect that <DisappearingMessage/> component is mounted for first time to have it's useEffect hook launched
 * after after first render (mount). If <DisappearingMessage/> is wrapped in some component that is shown/hidden using css
 * properties the transition won't happen as useEffect hook in <DisappearingMessage/> would already had been ran before when
 * wrapping component mounted
 *
